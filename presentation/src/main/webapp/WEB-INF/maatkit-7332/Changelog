     chunking functionality is still experimental and likely to change further.

   Changes:
   * Chunking now works with multiple-column indexes.
   * Added --quiet option, useful for cron jobs with --replicate.

2007-05-16: version 1.1.5

   Incompatible changes:
   * Output includes a new CHUNK column.
   * When using --replicate, the specified table structure needs a new 'chunk' column.

   Changes:
   * Added --chunksize and --chunkcol options to checksum tables in chunks.
   * Added --sleep option to pause between checksum queries.
   * Added --emptyrepltbl option to empty --replicate table before starting work.

   * Updated mk-checksum-filter to handle the new CHUNK column in the output.
   * More documentation.
   * More tests in the test suite.

   Bugs fixed:
   * The output in --replicate mode had an empty string in CHECKSUM when the
     table had no rows (bad for scriptability).
   * The --optxor optimization was broken and always disabled itself.

2007-05-05: version 1.1.0
